# Hi, I'm Lukas! üëã

### Data Scientist | Python Enthusiast | Industrial Data Expert | AI Innovator

I'm a Data Scientist with a versatile skill set that spans from hands-on electrical work to the analytical depths of industrial engineering. 
My approach is that of a generalist, always connecting the dots between different fields to solve problems with data. 
During my master's, I was drawn to data science through exciting projects, like using tweets to predict stock prices. 
But it was my master thesis on machine learning for bearing failure prediction that sealed the deal. 
Many nights of coding in Python and managing databases turned my interest into a true passion for data science.

After working in eMobility on energy-related datasets (2020‚Äì2022), I joined Ingersoll Rand in 2022, where I specialize in:
- **Time Series Analysis and Forecasting**
- **Condition Monitoring and Predictive Maintenance**
- **Big Data Analytics**
- **Data Visualization and Data Storytelling**
- **Machine Learning and Deep Learning**

Now, I‚Äôm expanding into **generative AI** with LangChain and Hugging Face, building cutting-edge tools for automated insights and workflows.
